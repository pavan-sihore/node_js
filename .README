Here are the basic Git commands to add a remote repository and push your local project to it:

---

### 🧱 Step-by-step Git commands

#### 1. Initialize Git (if not already initialized)

```bash
git init
```

#### 2. Add all files to staging

```bash
git add .
```

#### 3. Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

#### 4. Add the remote repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/pavan-sihore/node_js.git
```

#### 5. Push your code to the remote

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

> For newer Git versions, you might be using `main` instead of `master`:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 🔁 If Remote Already Exists and You Want to Change It

```bash
git remote set-url origin <new-URL>
```
