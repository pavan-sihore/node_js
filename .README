Here are the basic Git commands to add a remote repository and push your local project to it:

---

### 🧱 Step-by-step Git commands

#### 1. Initialize Git (if not already initialized)

```bash
git init
```

#### 2. Add all files to staging

```bash
git add .
```

#### 3. Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

#### 4. Add the remote repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/pavan-sihore/node_js.git
```

#### 5. Check the remote repository

```bash
git remote -v
```

#### 6.  Pull the remote branch
Note: If there’s nothing committed locally yet, you can safely pull:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### 6.1 Using Rebase Instead of Merge (optional)
Note: If you want to rebase your changes on top of the remote branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

#### 7. Push your code to the remote

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

> For newer Git versions, you might be using `main` instead of `master`:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### 🔁 If Remote Already Exists and You Want to Change It

```bash
git remote set-url origin <new-URL>
```
